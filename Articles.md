- [Sander Dielman’s Blog](https://sander.ai/posts/): Intuitive and technical articles on Diffusion Models in general. Eg. Classifier-free guidance etc. The article [_Diffusion models are autoencoders_](https://sander.ai/2022/01/31/diffusion.html) and [_Perspectives on diffusion_](https://sander.ai/2023/07/20/perspectives.html) are excellent reads.
- Diffusion models took off like a rocket at the end of 2019, after the publication of Song & Ermon’s [seminal paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05600). There is a [blog post](http://yang-song.net/blog/2021/score/) by Song that explains the intuition.
